For instance, if the goal is to not just increase awareness/interest for these events, but to ultimately get people to show up to whatever the experience is...(this doesn't really apply to me) but I know there are some people out there that will not make the effort to show up (even to a virtual event) if they do not have some confidence that people similar to them in some fashion will potentially be there as well (a la social proof).  Also considering it's invite only...I wonder if there an incentive structure for referrals
